I'll show you two pictures of pizza today.

The first one was painted. The second picture is the publicity map of pizza hut.

The painted pizza has been processed by art, emphasizing the details that the author wants to show. Such as the cheese on the pizza.

Its light and angle are perfect.

The pizza produced is the real pizza. It has the details of the first picture. For example, the baked parts. Whether you like it or not, they really exist.

It's hard to say which pizza looks more attractive. Some people like the first idealized pizza, but others feel that authenticity is more important than beauty. I prefer the first picture, because after all, what we see most is the real thing. While watching art works, I would like to know the author's thoughts.
